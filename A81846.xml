         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Good worke for good Magiſtrates, which was to have an act for peace makers, Sr. I have here incloſed, ſent you a rough draught of a ſimple one of mine own deviſing, I doe know that the Lawyers, and all the enemies of the Goſpell will with all their might oppoſe it, and although there be never ſo true a conception made by your Committee; yet it will be in danger to prove abortive, but I beſeech you let not your utmoſt indeavours be wanting. There are ſome other things with it, all which were ſent by my ſelf accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the date, unto the Lord Generall: I ſhall in due time, take the bouldneſſe to made an addition, although as yet I have had but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. The Act for peace makers is the 7. particular.</p>
                     <p>I deſire you, and ſome others to compleate it, and I doe conceive that ſuch an act may bringe much glory to God, much comfort, peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the people: God is pleaſed to pronounce Bleſſedneſs upon the peace makers, and truly I am afraid leaſt a curſe ſhould fall upon, or follow thoſe that have power to doe any thing tending thereunto, and doe not improve it, Sir I doe hope better things of you, and deſire you to ſtir up others to their duties, ſhurely there in great neglect in ſome, otherwiſe thoſe things that have been fought for, prayed for, &amp; payd for might have been injoyed by the people of this Nation before this time. I deſire you to communicate theſe to Collonel <hi>Disbrough,</hi> Maj. <hi>Parker,</hi> and ſome others, Sir</p>

                  <hi>A hearty well wiſher out of his good affections, was bould to offer theſe things to Conſideration, with earneſt deſires that ſome what in anſwer thereunto, might be acted. But beinge Conſcious of his own inability, and of the ltitlenes in them. ſaving a true zeale for Gods glory, and a deſire of the freedom, peace, and well being of this Nation, thought it his duty to publiſh them. to the view of all that Wiſh well to</hi> Zion, <hi>and to all the people of this Nation, intreating others to make ſome addition with a mendment; offering their humble deſires, and adreſſes, to the Supreame Authority of this Nation, the</hi> Parliament <hi>of the Commonwealth of</hi> England, <hi>for an eſtabliſhment of what ſhall be for the glory of God, and the good of the people, and doubt not but the</hi> Parliament <hi>will be very ready to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former Declarations, and Promiſes.</hi>
